# OIBSIP_Data_Analytics_Intership_Tasks
Welcome to the OIBSIP (Online Internship Projects) repository! This public repository contains the successful completion of three tasks that were assigned to me during my esteemed internship with Oasis Infobyte as a Data Science Intern from 10th  January 2025 to 15th February 2025. Working with this esteemed company has been an incredible experience, and I am immensely grateful for the opportunity. By making this repository accessible, I aim to demonstrate my skills and progress in data science to potential employers and the wider community. Additionally, it allows for collaboration and feedback from others interested in data science, fostering a learning and growth environment.

## TASK 2

- Project: **UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON**
- Description: Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project. 
- Dataset Provided: [Unemployment in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gokulrajkmv/unemployment-in-india)
- Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,Plotly, calender and datetime  
- Repository: The project's GitHub repository can be found at [TASK 2]().

## TASK 3

- Project: **CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING**
- Description: The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So if you want to learn how to train a car price prediction model then this project is for you.
- Dataset Provided: [Car data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayaadithyanvg/car-price-predictionused-cars)
- Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, datetime, and scikit-learn
- Models used: Gradient Boosting Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, XGBoost Regressor and Linear Regression  
- Repository: The project's GitHub repository can be found at [TASK 3]().
 
## TASK 4

- Project: **EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING**
- Description: We‚Äôve all been the recipient of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content. In this Project, we have to use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, we need to use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. 
- Dataset Provided: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
- Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, re, wordcloud, nltk and scikit-learn
- Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, KNN Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, SVM Classifier, Bagging Classifier, AdaBoost Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost Classifier and Decision Tree Classifier   
- Repository: The project's GitHub repository can be found at [TASK 4]().

## Conclusion

These tasks provided valuable hands-on experience and helped me enhance my skills as a Data Scientist. Within the duration of my internship, I successfully completed three challenging tasks that were provided to me by Oasis Infobyte. Each task presented unique challenges and opportunities for growth. I am truly proud of the work I have accomplished during my time here, and I hope that this repository can serve as an inspiration to others to be diligent, dedicated, and supportive in their roles within their respective companies. I am grateful for the learning experience and the chance to contribute to real-world data science projects. 

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to **Oasis Infobyte** for giving me this wonderful opportunity to learn and grow professionally. Working with such a remarkable company has been a privilege, and I am eager to continue contributing my best efforts to support the development of the companies I work with in the future.
